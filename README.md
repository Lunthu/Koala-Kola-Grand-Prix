# 🏁 Koala Kola Grand Prix — Retro Manager

Welcome to **Koala Kola Grand Prix**, a retro-style racing manager simulation built entirely in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This lightweight browser-based game lets you manage a racing team, strategize pit stops, and simulate races across a nostalgic pixel-art circuit.

## 🧪 Development Notes

- Uses a custom seeded RNG for consistent simulation behavior.
- Driver avatars are procedurally generated SVGs.
- Race physics are simplified but include tire effects, aggression modifiers, and pit stop penalties.
- No external libraries — pure vanilla JS.

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Add more race tracks and weather variability.
- Introduce driver traits and career progression.
- Expand UI with mobile responsiveness.
- Save/load seasons using localStorage or export/import.
